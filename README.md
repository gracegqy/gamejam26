What if a dating sim has life-or-death stakes? What if you looked at a video game through an NPC’s eyes? What if the only way to win was to manipulate the game’s files? All of these questions and more are answered in One Last Choice!

This is a visual novel/puzzle game, so there isn’t much to explain via tutorial. Everything you need to know is in-game!
